after exploit

always transfer files from your system to /tmp directory as good practice 

- cd /tmp
- upload /usr/share/shell
- etc from any commands ... 
- if exploit provides resource script to delete files that are unused, always keep note of modules used
- resources /path/to/file
- clearev (clear windows eventlogs)
