- **Step 6:** Automating local enumeration with LinEnum

Now that we have explored how to use Metasploit modules to automate local enumeration on a Windows target, we can begin exploring how to use LinEnum.

LinEnum is a bash script that is used by penetration testers automate local enumeration and identify privilege escalation vectors on Linux systems.

In order to use this script, you will need to copy the script in to your lab environment. To begin with, you can access the script through the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum

Once you have copied the script from the GitHub repo, navigate back to the Kali Linux system in your lab environment and create a new file with a text editor like leafpad.

Then paste in the script you copied in the file, after which save the file as **LinEnum.sh** as shown in the following screenshots.

- CTRL + SHIFT + ALT ( to paste from clipboard) 
- cd /tmp
- upload /root/Desktop/LinEnum.sh
- shell
- /bin/bash -i
- chmod +x linnum.sh
- ./linenum.sh
