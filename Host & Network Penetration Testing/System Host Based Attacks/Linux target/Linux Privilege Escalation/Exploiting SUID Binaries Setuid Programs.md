we found that we have 's' set uid in file like this 
- -rwsr-xr-x 1 root    root    8344 Sep 22  2018 welcome
- file (to know file type)
- strings (to get only the words not symbols)
- Observe that the welcome binary has suid bit set (or on). This means that this binary and its child processes will run with root privileges. Check the file type
- So, replace the greetings binary with some other binary (say /bin/bash) which should then also get executed as root.
- cp /bin/bash greetings (we will remove the old greetings and our own greetings which contains the same name so the system use our file because it's the same name , how did we know that ? we have found the name in welcome file using 'strings' command and found that greetings is a subprocess of our main file)
