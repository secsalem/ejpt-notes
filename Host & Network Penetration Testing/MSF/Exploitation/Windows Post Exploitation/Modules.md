automate the enumeration of the current user privileges. We can load the module by running the following comand:
- use post/windows/gather/win_privs

enumerates a list of currently and previous logged on users.
- use post/windows/gather/enum_logged_on_users

whether the target system is a VM or container
- use post/windows/gather/checkvm

enumerates a list of installed application/programs on the target system.
- use post/windows/gather/enum_applications
```
Â This information is very useful as it can be used to search for vulnerabilities in the installed programs that can be leveraged or exploited to elevate your privileges or reveal important information. It also gives you an idea as to what this system is being used for.
